== Research Interests
I have dedicated myself to the development of smart cities via principle-based and data-driven approaches. 
My primary focus lies at the intersection of data science, decision-making, control, applied mathematics, and industrial artificial intelligence, with their applications to smart grid and intelligent transportation.
My interest spans various areas, including data analytics, statistical learning, online and combinatorial optimization, partial order programming, matrix theory, graph theory, game theory, and control theory.


== PhD, Mphil, RA, PostDoc, and Visiting Scholar Opportunities

[https://www.ln.edu.hk/rpg/admission/application-for-admission *!!! PhD Positions Available (2026-27 Spring/Fall Intake) !!!*]

Highly motivated students and postdocs are encouraged to explore opportunities within her group, working on developing smart cities via principle-based and data-driven approaches. Successful Mphil/PhD candidates will be provided with a [https://www.ln.edu.hk/rpg/admission/financial-support full scholarship]. Exceptional PhD candidates will be nominated for the [https://www.ln.edu.hk/rpg/hong-kong-phd-fellowship-scheme-hkpfs Hong Kong PhD Fellowship]. Postdocs can consider applying for the [https://www.ln.edu.hk/hr/lu-presidential-postdoctoral-research-fellowship-scheme-pprf LU Presidential Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Scheme (PPRF).] If you have the passion, feel free to send your resume along with an explanation of your motivations and aspirations.\n

I am confident that we can chat and uncover potentials about the topics toward smart cities, including but not limited to
- Data science for smart cities such as reduced-dimensional dynamic data analytics;
- Partial order programming (POP), e.g., optimization with majorization-ordered objectives;
- Resource allocation in smart cities, including online optimization and unmanned traffic management (UTM);
- Emerging lifestyles for smart cities, like demand-centered service design.

The following qualities will greatly enhance our intellectual journey:
- Curiosity and self-motivation;
- Sharing and respecting;
- Lifelong learning;
- Dedication.




# \[2024 Fall\] Ph.D. position available. Feel free to send me your resume if you have passion in research and want to join my group as a Ph.D. student. 

# \[RA\/Internship\] RA/intership position available anytime. Students who have interest in research internship or gap year research assistant positions are more than welcome to contact me.
